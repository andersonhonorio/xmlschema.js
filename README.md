# xmlschema.js
Implementation of XML schema validation in pure javascript, this project is currently incomplete, but I wanted to check it in. 
This will validate xml against a schema, but I only implemented the features I required... the rest will be completed as I have
time unless someone else wants to contribute to finish this work.

Things that need doing still: attributes, groups, inline complexTypes ... more research.
